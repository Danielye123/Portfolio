      Filmpire, an AI-Powered Movie review application that was developed using React.
      The app boasts features such as integration with the IMDB API, Search, Categories, Genres etc.

      <br /><br />

      I developed this movie review application with the help of JavaSript Mastery, who taught me a lot absolute
      creating websites such as this one.

      <br /><br />

      This application was the start of my journey into web development and greatly bolstered my interest in it thanks to the uniqueness of the application 
      and the potential to create similar designs like this one from scratch.
