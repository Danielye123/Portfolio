      Morent, a cutting-edge car rental application that was developed using the
      MERN stack. The app boasts a dynamic homepage that showcases featured
      vehicles, along with convenient pickup & drop-off location options & a
      comprehensive list of available cars. 

      <br /><br />

      My team and I also developed the car
      listing page which offers a search bar and various filtering options for
      users to find the perfect vehicle. Additionally, it has a car details page
      which provides users with detailed information along with suggestions for
      other recommended vehicles. 

      <br /><br />

      Car owners are also able to list their cars
      for rent through our Add Car page, while users can easily track their
      rented and rented-out cars through their profile page. Overall, we've
      created an intuitive and user-friendly MVP version of the platform that
      will make renting a car a breeze.
